Shooter based programming language

A programming language based upon a shooter, shooting numbers onto targets (methods).

Documentation may be created upon request. Until that, you can figure it out by reading the code.
The same goes for a visual representation of the events, other than the list itself.

How to use:
```
python shooter.py <filename> <delay in seconds>
```
